[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/defexample.svg)](https://clojars.org/defexample)

## Introduction

A library that provides two macros, `defexample` and `defexamples`, for annotating functions with code examples, similar to the way clojure.spec annotates functions with specs using `fdef`.

See [the defexample Dynadocs](https://oakes.github.io/defexample/) for more information! These docs were generated by using these macros to define examples of themselves.

## Usage

You can include this library in your project dependencies using the version number in the badge above.

To experiment with this library in a REPL, you can use [the Clojure CLI tool](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started#_clojure_installer_and_cli_tools). In this directory, run `clj` to start a Clojure REPL, or `clj -R:cljs -m cljs.repl.node` to start a ClojureScript REPL. When the REPL is up, enter the main namespace with `(require 'dynadoc.example) (in-ns 'dynadoc.example)`.
